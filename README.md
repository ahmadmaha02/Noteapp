# Getting Started with React & Vite.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
npm install
npm run dev

#Command Line Interface
In a project where Vite is installed, you can use the vite binary in your npm scripts, or run it directly with npx vite. Here are the default npm scripts in a scaffolded Vite project:

json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite", // start dev server, aliases: `vite dev`, `vite serve`
    "build": "vite build", // build for production
    "preview": "vite preview" // locally preview production build
  }
}
